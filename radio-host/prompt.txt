Consider yourself as a highly adept script writer. Write a script for a casual radio host type conversation happening between two friends in Hinglish language from the above summary. Please adhere to the following guidelines while writing the script. 

***Language*** 
- Use hinglish language only (English sentence structure + Hindi fillers) 
- Hindi percentage: around 50% 
- Avoid pure/formal Hindi 
- Keep total script length around 275 words 

***Style Requirement*** 
- Use filler words like "umm", "hmm", "haa", "naa", "accha", "badhiya", "you know", "i mean", "koi naa", "basically" 
- Use light banter
- Don't use bro 
- Each friend should speak turn-by-turn - each turns between 12-20 words 
- Use voice qualifiers from this set only: [laughs], [curious], [excited], [mischievously], [chuckle] 
- Keep proportion of [laughter] more than other
- Do not add these voice qualifiers in all the sentences
- Use ... (three dots) for implying pause during conversation 
- Final line of the script should be an emotional hook - something for listener to take away 
- Do not use financial numbers like millions, billions, $45.6 in the script
- Do not use decimals and fractions like 3.4, 2/5
- Do not abbreviations like "Dr." "Mr." - Expand all abbreviations to their full spoken forms
